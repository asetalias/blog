      <description>Four years of college life in Amity, during which I went through a lot of ups and downs, nailed it at sometimes while screwed it at some (yeah college life plays both ways). Being extremely passionate about computers, I always looked for learning opportunities in this field outside of the curriculum. But neither the technical clubs nor events could fulfill the quest, as they meant nothing more than ways to get some certificates or to bunk classes.</description>

      <description>Rust is the system programming language for the future. Quite a presumptuous statement, said my confreres. I would be inclined to agree with them but for the experience of the agony of using C.
 “Having been tortured by C during my years of wiring security-critical software, I don’t think I exaggerate when I compare programming in it with walking through a minefield.” by Ivan Ristic, Founder of SSL Labs</description>

      <description>Flutter is Google’s portable UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively-compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
More on Flutter&amp;hellip; According to me, Flutter has a very bright future ahead as Google is using Flutter for the development of their own apps. It has very expressive and Flexible UI and it is famous for its Native Performance. The main challenge is that cross-platform development can be problematic.</description>

      <title>Becoming a Debian Maintainer in 90 days!</title>

      <description>NOTE: I know this should have been posted long, long back :(
However, life happened and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Anyway, here it goes..
I started contributing to open source around a year back and on 1st January 2019 to Debian, specifically (wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a new year resolution, though :P).
I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest here. The reason behind taking the &amp;ldquo;Debian road&amp;rdquo; was solely to distract myself from the mental abuse I was going through.</description>

      <description>ALiAS is the largest open-source community at Amity University and as one of the founding member of our small 500+ active member community nothing makes me happier than writing about it and looking back on our accomplishments, failures and new initiatives.
ALiAS started out back in 2010, has now come a long way. After kickstarting it back in 2016, we have climbed several rungs in the ladder of success and with the support of our members, we will continue to do.</description>

      <description>(This blog starts off with a warning: Although the process is super easy and there hardly is a chance that you will brick your device during the process but, it&amp;rsquo;s my responsibility to make you aware of it)
The guide would be inclined more towards Xiaomi devices as I own one and have worked with it. But, all other devices follow the same process, so go ahead and give it a read.</description>

      <description>How and when it all started? I started my college here at Amity in 2017 till then I was completely unaware of how the communities work. Few days passed, I started exploring events in colleges than one of my friends told me about ALiAS also known as (Amity Linux Assistance Sapience). He told me that there is something also known as Open-Source and this community supports open source and this community is one of its kind in the college.</description>

      <description>The first time, getting introduced to the world of development, I was amazed! exploring a number of technologies in the initial days of my B.Tech just for the sake of knowledge and after working on few of them at last chose, web development as my primary field.
One of my classmate suggested me to join ALiAS, a coding community of Amity University, Noida which was the main branch of our college.</description>
