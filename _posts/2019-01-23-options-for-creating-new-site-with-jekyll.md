`jekyll new <PATH>` installs a new Jekyll site at the path specified (relative to current directory). In this case, Jekyll will be installed in a directory called `myblog`. Here are some additional details:

- To install the Jekyll site into the directory you're currently in, run `jekyll new` . If the existing directory isn't empty, you can pass the --force option with jekyll new . --force.
- `jekyll new` automatically initiates `bundle install` to install the dependencies required. (If you don't want Bundler to install the gems, use `jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle`.)
- By default, the Jekyll site installed by `jekyll new` uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.
- We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use `jekyll new myblog --blank`
- To learn about other parameters you can include with `jekyll new`, type `jekyll new --help`.
