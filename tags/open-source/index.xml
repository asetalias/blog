However, life happened and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Anyway, here it goes..
I started contributing to open source around a year back and on 1st January 2019 to Debian, specifically (wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a new year resolution, though :P).
I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest here. The reason behind taking the &amp;ldquo;Debian road&amp;rdquo; was solely to distract myself from the mental abuse I was going through.</description></item><item><title>Community Unpacked</title><link>http://asetalias.in/blog/post/alias-lucknow-journey-akshat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://asetalias.in/blog/post/alias-lucknow-journey-akshat/</guid><description>The first time, getting introduced to the world of development, I was amazed! exploring a number of technologies in the initial days of my B.Tech just for the sake of knowledge and after working on few of them at last chose, web development as my primary field.
One of my classmate suggested me to join ALiAS, a coding community of Amity University, Noida which was the main branch of our college.</description></item><item><title>ALiAS : My first open-source community</title><link>http://asetalias.in/blog/post/journey-with-open-source-community/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://asetalias.in/blog/post/journey-with-open-source-community/</guid><description>How and when it all started? I started my college here at Amity in 2017 till then I was completely unaware of how the communities work. Few days passed, I started exploring events in colleges than one of my friends told me about ALiAS also known as (Amity Linux Assistance Sapience). He told me that there is something also known as Open-Source and this community supports open source and this community is one of its kind in the college.</description></item></channel></rss>
