      <description>NOTE: I know this should have been posted long, long back :(
However, life happened and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Anyway, here it goes..
I started contributing to open source around a year back and on 1st January 2019 to Debian, specifically (wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a new year resolution, though :P).
I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest here. The reason behind taking the &amp;ldquo;Debian road&amp;rdquo; was solely to distract myself from the mental abuse I was going through.</description>
