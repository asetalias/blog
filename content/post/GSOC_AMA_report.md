[**ALiAS**](http://asetalias.in) is the largest open-source community at **Amity University** and as one of the founding member of our small **500+ active member community** nothing makes me happier than writing about it and looking back on our accomplishments, failures and new initiatives.

**ALiAS** started out back in **2010**, has now come a long way. After kickstarting it back in 2016, we have climbed several rungs in the ladder of success and with the support of our members, we will continue to do. The GSoC **Ask Me Anything** initiative is proof of the same. Here's the results first, before we dive deeper into our brand new initiative.

It being an honored and proud moment for ALiAS, that this year a **total of 9 students got selected in Google Summer of Code, from Amity University, Noida and all of them, are the members of ALiAS!**

Well, if you don't know what is GSoC. Here's a brief overview.

## What is GSoC?

**GSoC** is a **12-week program**, sponsored by Google  to promote open-source among various college students around the world, where the people selected (Only **1200+ students** total) are assigned to projects from different open-source organizations working over the summer contributing to open-source software. You can learn more about GSoC from [here](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/123gsoc/).

</div>

**Selected students** get a stipend, loads of experience and skills working under professional mentors. **ALiAS AMA program** has been all about mentoring our members and whosoever that is interested in learning about open-source and willing to contribute to it.

We invited **GSoC mentors**, **admins** and **students** from every major organisation in our networks to get their insights, experience and most importantly answer questions. Our ideology is that **no question is dumb**. And when you believe in this, that's when you know that one could be truly open in this environment.

Henceforth, we had **15 mentors**, for **15 days** straight. For a streak of webinars, live sessions, daily meetups, proposal reviews, chats, doubt clearing, and motivational AMA's.

**AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions** from the very beginning, have been completely **open** with people coming from together to help, mentor and participate in the program resulting in a nine times the selection this year compared to last 3 years! **This was only possible because of our beliefs, teamwork and true hard work.**

> Be the change you want to see in the world 
> or at least try ...

Every bit of this, couldn't be completed or even imagined without the help and direct input from the ALiAS Volunteer team who works hard to lead new initiatives, work with us on so many challenges. I would like to take some time to especially mention the people who constantly worked behind the AMA program, making it a success.
