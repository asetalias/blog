# ALiAS does it again: Report on our GSoC AMA program

[ALiAS](https://asetalias.in) is the largest open-source community at Amity University and as one of the founding member of our small 500+ active member community nothing makes me more happier than writing about it and looking back on our accomplishments, failures and new initiatives.

ALiAS started out back in 2010, has now come a long way. After kickstarting it back in 2016, we have climbed several rungs in the ladder of success and with the support of our members we will continue to do. The GSoC Ask Me Anything program is a proof of the same. Here's a result, before we dive deeper.

It's being an honored and proud moment for ALiAS, that this year a **total of 9 students got selected in Google Summer of Code, from Amity University, Noida and all of them, are the members of ALiAS!** 
  
Well, if you don't know what is GSoC. Here's a brief overview.

## What is GSoC?

GSoC is a 12 week program, sponsored by Google LLC to promote open-source among various college students around the world, where the people selected (Only 1200+ students total) are assigned to projects from different open-source organizations working over the summer contributing to open-source and helping them learn and contribute. You can learn more about GSoC from [here](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/123gsoc/).

**Selected students** get a stipend, loads of experience and skills working under professional mentors. ALiAS AMA program has been all about mentoring our members and whosoever that is interested in learning about open-source and willing to contribute to it. 

We invited GSoC mentors, and students from every major organisation in our networks to get their insights, experience and most importantly answer questions. Our ideology is that **no question is dumb**. And when you believe in this, that's when you know that one could be truly open in this environment. 

Henceforth, we had 15 mentors, for 15 days straight. Webinars, live sessions, daily meetups, proposal reviews, chats, doubt clearing, and motivational AMA's.

AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions from the very beginning, have been completely open with people coming from together to help, mentor and participate in the program resulting in a nine times the selection this year compared to last 3 years! This was only possible because of our beliefs, teamwork and true hard work.
