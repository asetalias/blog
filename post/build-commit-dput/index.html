<a href=http://asetalias.in/blog/tags/open-source/>open-source</a></p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I know this should have been posted long, long back :(<br>However, life happened and I couldn&rsquo;t. Anyway, here it goes..</p><p>I started contributing to open source around a year back and on 1st January
2019 to Debian, specifically (wasn&rsquo;t really a new year resolution, though :P).<br>I&rsquo;ll be honest here. The reason behind taking the &ldquo;Debian road&rdquo; was solely to
distract myself from the mental abuse I was going through.</p><p><a href=https://nm.debian.org/person/rajudev>Raju</a> was the person who started helping me out,
both, personally and professionally. He&rsquo;s the one who taught me packaging from
scratch with utmost patience and kept answering all my stupid doubts :D<br>To be honest, if it weren&rsquo;t for him, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been here, at this
position today.</p><p>Since I wanted to distract myself from various stuff, I learned things quickly and
kept working, <em>consistently</em>.<br>I turned up on IRC every single day since then.
<a href=https://nm.debian.org/person/praveen>Praveen</a> became both, my guru and my package
sponsorer. He kept uploading and I kept packaging. This went on for a month
until my difficulty level was bumped. From basic Ruby gems and Node libraries, I
was given gems and modules that had test failures to debug and had a weirdly
different build system. This made me uncomfortable. I complained. To which,
Praveen said and I quote,<br><code>"If you want to keep working on simple stuff, then it's not gonna help you move forward. And it's your loss. No one else would care. So it's your call."</code></p><p>There was probably no option there, was it? :P<br>I took it on. Struggled for a few days but it became normal and I made it
through. Like <code>they</code> say, &ldquo;It gets better :)", it did!<br>I took a little more challenging stuff, understood more concepts. Fixed test
failures, RC bugs and learned a lot of stuff (still a lot, lot more to learn,
though) in the process, like understanding about the Debian release cycle, how
the migration of package takes place, setting up your own repositories, et al.</p><p>In this process, I also met another JS guru, <a href=https://nm.debian.org/person/yadd>Xavier</a>.
He did not only corrected my mistakes and sponsored my packages, but also helped me
in actually understanding a lot of things. From the mailing list, we started
conversing over private mail threads and soon, in a span of 3 months, the thread
stretched over to 300 mails!</p><p>In early March, I was told that I could apply for the position of the
Debian Maintainer, if only I understood the process of when to upload a package
to experimental and when to unstable. I was given a few packages as a test by
Praveen for the same.<br>And luckily, I passed. This meant that the only part remaining was to fulfill
the initial keysigning requirement. For which, there was a Mini DebConf, Delhi
around the corner.</p><p>As it happened, Praveen, Abhijith, and Sruthi came to the Mini DebConf from
Kerala and I got my keys signed by them! :D<br>Soon after, I applied for becoming a DM.</p><p>I was lucky enough to get 3 advocates, Praveen, Xavier, and Abhijith.<br>Here&rsquo;s my <a href=https://nm.debian.org/process/605>NM Process (#605)</a>.<br>And in a few days, I realized that I became the youngest Debian Maintainer in
India \o/</p><p>I thank myself for being consistent, no matter what I started for :P<br>Also, much thanks to <a href=https://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana>Sanyam</a>. He really
kept me going. Also, to <a href=https://twitter.com/suseLEAP>Jatin</a> and
<a href=https://twitter.com/sakshisangwan04>Sakshi</a>.</p><p>Lastly, thanks to the Debian community. Debian has really been an amazing
journey, an amazing place, and an amazing family.
I am just hoping to make it to DebConf and meet all the people I adore \o/</p><p>Until next time.<br><code>:wq</code> for today.</p><p><b>Author:</b> Utkarsh Gupta</p></section></div><footer id=footer><section class="split contact"><section><h3>Social</h3><ul class="icons alt"><li><a href=https://twitter.com/AsetALiAS class="icon fa-twitter"><span class=label>Twitter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/asetalias/ class="icon fa-facebook"><span class=label>Facebook</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/asetalias/ class="icon fa-linkedin"><span class=label>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/asetalias class="icon fa-github"><span class=label>GitHub</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKkyqEMLFW3jz-q3nJIFL3g class="icon fa-youtube"><span class=label>Youtube</span></a></li></ul></section></section></footer><div id=copyright><ul><li>&copy; ALiAS Writes</li><li>Design: <a href=https://html5up.net>HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Hugo Port: <a href=https://curtistimson.co.uk>curttimson</a></li></ul></div></div><script src=/blog/assets/js/bundle.js></script></body></html>
